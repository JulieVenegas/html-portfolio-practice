<h1>Best Movies in the world</h1>
<h2>A tottally not accuarite list of Julie's favorite movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Because I imagine Howl's as a cute and strong woman going through a really hard life. She looks lonely, just like me; she changes her hair color, just like me. And I am sure she wishes to be loved by someone else for just who she is, just like me.</p>
<h3>Avatar the Way of Water</h3>
<p>I know, I know, this one is kind of not everybody's choice, but there is something so, I don't know, beautiful about the whole idea of being able to have a second chance in life in a sci-fi world—maybe any cool world, but sci-fi rocks (insert chuckles). Even though you are a total stranger, still managing to be happy, to be able to escape the hell of your past life, to meet the love of your life. I feel like such a ray of sunshine right now, hahaha, but meh. Also, the pictures and takes and effects are insane in this movie, and families that would actually care are a cute feeling. I mean, even the bad guy cared for his monkey son.</p>
<h3>Star Wars the one where Anakin get burn</h3>
<p>I mean, I don't know. I really like fantasy and sci-fi, and Star Wars, in particular, is captivating. My boy Ani is a dummy in love, trying to do anything in his power to save the person he cares about the most. I think that in itself shows the vulnerability of people when they are madly in love. I think his sentiment was noble, and I would've gone down the dark path if that meant saving the only person I love. Yet again, what is dark and what is light? There is no justice, no matter what path you take—only pain. So maybe, in the end, it would have been better for all of them to quit being Jedi and go enjoy the life they had. Because control is an illusion, and I think this movie shows us clearly that.</p>
